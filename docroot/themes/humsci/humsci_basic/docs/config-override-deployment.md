# Deploying new components without impacting legacy and existing site configuration(s)

Stanford University Humanities & Sciences supports the creation of multiple websites. Sparkbox is assisting with the implementation of new themes to support updates to their client's sites. The themes that currently exist can be categorized as legacy and current.

## Legacy site themes:
* SU_HUMSCI_THEME (base theme)
  * Archaeology
  * France-Stanford
  * Mathematics
  * Stanford HumSci SubTheme

## Current site themes:
* Humsci Basic (base theme)
  * Humsci Colorful
  * Humsci Traditional
  * Humsci Airy (future)
