# Humsci Basic (humsci_basic) Theme

Humsci Basic (humsci_basic) is a theme that can be used as a base for future H&S themes. We have pulled patterns and templates for Humsci Basic from Stanford Basic (stanford_basic) and Stanford University Humsci Theme (su_humsci_theme) Themes. Humsci Basic integrates selectively with Decanter (v6) Sass, styles, and patterns.

## Requirements

- Drupal 8.7.10
- Node 10.15+

## Sub-themes

There are currently 3 children sub-themes based on Humsci Basic. Themes reference built CSS files in Humsci Basic on a per-theme basis in their `{}.libraries.yml`.

- Humsci Colorful (humsci_colorful)
- Humsci Traditional (humsci_traditional)
- Humsci Airy (humsci_airy)

## Getting Started

This theme contains its own node module dependencies and build system which is separate from the root project. All commands should be run from this theme's directory.

- `npm install` - Install all node dependencies

## Builds

Frontend assets are built using the Grunt task runner, but are run using npm scripts as shortcuts. CSS assets are compiled to their respective child theme `css/` directory. JS assets are compiled to the `scripts/build/scripts.js` file.

- `npm start` - Runs the build task followed by the watch task
- `npm run build` - Compile Sass  and JS for production
- `npm run watch` - Compile a CSS and JS build and watch for changes in the existing `.scss` or `.js` files

## Testing

- `npm test` - Run linting and sass true tests

### Sass True

We use the [Sass True](https://github.com/oddbird/true) testing framework to test our Sass function and mixins.

### Linting

We use [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to lint all of our Sass code to maintain a consistent code style.

Our linting rules use the [Sparkbox Stylelint Config](https://github.com/sparkbox/stylelint-config-sparkbox) as a base for our linting rules.

### Visual Regression Testing
[Backstopjs](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) is a CLI visual regression tool that uses headless Chrome.

The visual regression tests are run locally and used to compare what is on Production versus what is on your local machine.

#### Adding new scenarios in the `backstop/backstop.json`.
The format should look like the following:
```
"scenarios": [
  {
    "label": "Customize site",
    "url": "http://swshumsci.suhumsci.loc/site-building/customize-site",
    "referenceUrl": "https://swshumsci-prod.stanford.edu/site-building/customize-site",
    "delay": 0,
    "requireSameDimensions": true
  }
]
```
Before running Backstop for the first time you will need to create an `.env` file. Copy the contents in `docroot/themes/humsci/humsci_basic/.env-sample` and place them in your `.env` file. Add the basic auth credentials. They can be found in 1Password under `Stanford Basic Auth`.

Visual regression testing should be completed bi-weekly at the end of each sprint. To get the best results, sync your local environment against staging before running Backstop.

1. Go to the [staging environment](https://sparkbox-sandbox-stage.stanford.edu/). Take note of which theme (Colorful or Traditional) and color pairing is on staging and update your local environment to match.
1. Cd the `humsci_basic` directory.
1. Run `npm run backstop:init` to save a copy of the Backstop config to `./backtop/backstop.js`.
1. Run `npm run backstop:reference` to generate reference images, in our case reference is staging.
1. Run `npm run backstop:test` to run the tests.
1. Backstop will open an HTML page that contains the report which highlights errors.
_Note: Differences in content will also be reported as failures._

## Contributing
### Github
To make it easier to find work being done we should use the following naming conventions:

### Branch Names:
`STN-XXX--descriptive-message`

#### Commit Messages:
`feat(STN-XXX): descriptive message shorter than 80 chars`
`fix(STN-XXX): descriptive message shorter than 80 chars`
`refactor(STN-XXX): descriptive message shorter than 80 chars`
`chore(STN-XXX): descriptive message shorter than 80 chars`
`docs(STN-XXX): descriptive message shorter than 80 chars`

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/

#### Pull Request Titles:
`STN-XXX: Short Descriptive Titles`

Pull request descriptions should follow the PR template that is generated when creating a new commit.

#### Green Button Merging:
After receiving a review and getting a PR approved, we do green-button merges for our PRs ("Rebase and Merge") because Github includes a link to the PR in our commit message header.

## Decanter Integration

This theme aims to **partially** integrate [Decanter](https://github.com/SU-SWS/decanter). Instead of rendering all the styles generated by Decanter we:

- Import variables, function and mixins
- Compile various helpers classes
- Compile specific components such as Brand Bar, Logo, Lockup and Footer

## CSS / Sass
The CSS is organized using [Harry Robertsâ€™](https://csswizardry.com) [Inverted Triangle CSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) (ITCSS) organizational approach. This method is mixed with [Block Element Modifier](http://getbem.com/) (BEM) naming convention for class names throughout the Sass files.
