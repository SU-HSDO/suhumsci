# 0. Record architecture decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are going to start using ADR's in the repo to record major architecture decisions. We needed to evaluate what process we were going to use and where to put them.

## Decision

We decided to start by using the [Lightweight Architecture Decisions](https://github.com/peter-evans/lightweight-architecture-decision-records) framework for ADR's.

## Consequences

A new `/docs/architecture/decisions` directory has been added to store ADR's. ADR's will also become a part of our regular process and should be included in any PR's with major architecture changes.
